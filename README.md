# Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS)

## Overview
The Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) is a state-of-the-art solution developed for the Department of the Police to enhance road safety and streamline traffic monitoring. The system detects traffic violations such as no-helmet riding and triple riding, significantly improving rider safety and facilitating large-scale monitoring by traffic police.

## Project Description
The ITMS project was undertaken as a part of a state government initiative to improve traffic safety and enforcement efficiency. As the team lead, I spearheaded the development and implementation of the system, which leverages advanced analytics and edge computing to detect traffic violations and provide real-time data to traffic police.

### Objectives
- Detect and report traffic violations such as no-helmet riding and triple riding.
- Enhance rider safety in local areas.
- Facilitate large-scale traffic monitoring and enforcement.
- Increase the efficiency of the traffic department by 100%.

## Features
- **Violation Detection**: Automatically detects and reports no-helmet riders and triple riders.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time data and analytics to traffic police for efficient monitoring.
- **Dockerized Analytics Server**: Implements advanced analytics on a Docker server, enhancing monitoring capabilities.
- **Data Management with MongoDB**: Utilizes MongoDB for robust data management and seamless integration with the GUI application via APIs.
- **Edge Computing**: Deploys analytics on edge devices for real-time processing and reduced latency.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: For containerizing the analytics server and deploying on client systems.
- **MongoDB**: For efficient data storage and management.
- **Python**: For backend development and analytics.
- **APIs**: For seamless connectivity between the database and the GUI application.
- **Edge Devices**: For deploying analytics and reducing latency.
